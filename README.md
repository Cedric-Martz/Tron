# Tron
I was bored, so I started this.

# What is it ?
Directly inspired by this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron

# Requirement

You may just need to install curses. Time and random should already be installed.
``` bash
pip install windows-curses
```

# Usage

To launch the game, simply type:
``` bash
python tron.py
```

# Gamemode

You can play with up to 4 players; each player has a color.

If you're alone, you can play against a drunk and depressed AI.

# Upcoming

If I am bored again, I plan to add multiplayer to the game...
