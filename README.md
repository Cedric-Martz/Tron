# Tron
I was bored, so I started this.

# What is it ?
Directly inspired by this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron

# Requirement

This game was tested on Windows and Linux.
You may just need to install curses. Time and random should already be installed. And yes, you need python.
``` bash
pip install windows-curses
```

# Usage

To launch the game, simply type:
``` bash
python tron.py
```

# Commands

If you play solo, default keys are the arrows keys. If you play in multiplayer, you have to configure the used keys for each players.
This is simply done in the game, just read.

In any games, space key PAUSE the game. Putting your computer in sleeping mode doen't break the game.

# Gamemode

You can play with up to 4 players; each player has a color.

If you're alone, you can play against an AI with various levels of difficulty available.

# Upcoming

If I am bored again, I plan to add multiplayer to the game...
